# Automated-Irrigation-System-using-ZigBee-GSM
In recent years, Distributed Wireless sensor technology becomes very popular and extensively used in
the scientific world. The WSN helps in the advancement of the current developing and rapidly changing technology.
Power management, cost-saving and labour-saving is always a major issue in the research field of wireless sensor
networks. This project gives a review of some existing or proposed systems based on the different technologies and also
focuses on generic automated irrigation system based on WSN with GSM-ZigBee for remote monitoring and
controlling devices. The objective is to make use of wireless sensor network and communication technology such as
ZigBee and GSM in industrial field to make low-cost automated irrigation system to monitor the condition of the soil
and to lower the energy consumption. The system helps the farmer to monitor and control the parameters of the soil
such as air temperature, humidity, soil moisture. At any abnormal condition, the farmer is informed and will be able to
take actions remotely by using GSM. Due to its lower energy consumption and low cost, the system has the potential to
be useful in semiarid or arid areas.
